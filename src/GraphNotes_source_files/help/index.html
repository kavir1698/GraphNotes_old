        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p> Researching requires you to know many specific facts about different topics. You will also need to know credible
            references for those facts. To tackle this problem, the first thing that people do is to refer to encyclopedias,
            such as Wikipedia, or textbooks to find their answers. If you have a university account with access to paid scientific
            journals, you may also look into journal papers. This is, however, extremely time consuming. If you are writing
            a research papers, for every paragraph of the introduction of the discussion, you likely need know and cite multiple
            facts. Going through books and papers to find each fact is hard enough, you will soon forget most of what you
            have once looked for if you need them in the future. </p>

        <p>A traditional method for gathering all the necessary information has been using paper note cards. In a note card,
            one writes a fact or information they thinks will be useful, along with a reference for it. They would later
            organize the note cards and use them for writing. This method has a few drawbacks, namely over time, it will
            be difficult to keep all the cards organized and it will become more and more difficult to find a specific card.
            Therefore, people would usually make new cards for each new project.</p>

        <p>With the GraphNotes, we fix these problems, and introduce new functionalities for researching more efficiently. In
            this program, you can record every new interesting fact or information (we call them concepts from now on) you
            come across. For each concept, you may add as many different descriptions with different references as you like.
            Additionally, you can add descriptions for how two different concepts are related. As a result, whenever you
            need a specific information, you can search for descriptions of a concept or how two concepts relate.</p>

        <h2> How to use it? </h2>
        <h3> Initializing the program for the first time </h3>
        <p> If it is the first time that you open this program, it you can specify a location and name for the program's database.
            It will be where your data will be stored.
            <h3> Adding a single concept and its descriptions </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Click on the <i> Add data </i> button. </li>
                <li> Type information in the <i> Concept 1 </i> section </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> To make organizing information easier, each concept has a <i> Subcategory </i> field. Use the <i> Subcategory </i>                        field to add specific details about a more generation concept. For example, if you want to add information
                        about the speed of light, you may type "Light" in the concept field, and type "Speed of" in the subcategory
                        field. </li>

                    <li> The <i> Synonyms </i> field is for writing other ways that the same concept may be written, so that searching
                        for either of them will return the same retuls. </li>

                    <li> The <i>Study</i> field specifies the type of study of the reference, e.g. it can be an experimental or
                        a theoretical study. </li>

                    <li> To add a reference, right click in the white are of the <i>Reference</i> field and click on the <i>New reference</i> option. You may either type in the reference details, import references from a bibtex file, or most conveniently, if you have a DOI, enter it and the program will grab the reference automatically. </li>

                    <li> You may leave any field blank. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3> Adding a relation between two concepts </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Click on the <i> Add data </i> button. </li>
                <li> Type the first concept, and if you like a <i> Subcategory </i> for the first concept. </li>
                <li> Type the second concept, and if you like a <i> Subcategory </i> for the second concept. </li>
                <li> Type a description for the relation between the two concepts in the <i>Relatin</i> field. </li>
                <li> You may add a study type in the <i> Study </i> field.</li>
                <li> To add a reference, wright click in the white are of the <i>Reference</i> field and click on the <i>New reference</i>                    option. You may either type in the reference details or import references from a bibtex file.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Searching </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Type in a work in the <i> Search </i> field in the main window. </li>
                <li> Use check boxes below the search field to specify where to search. </li>
                <li> The search results appear in the <i> Concepts</i> area. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> All the steps above can be repeated, i.e. a concept can have multiple descriptions and relations. </p>
