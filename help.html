            <h2>What is GraphNotes?</h2>

            <h3> The problem: </h3>
            <p> Research requires remembering many facts and details with credible references. It is easy to forget a specifc piece of information after a few days or months, or forget where we read it. Scientists usually mark PDF files or write down important details in a text documents. These files can quickly pile up and make it tedious to find specific pieces of information.</p>

            <p>A traditional method for gathering all the necessary information is using paper note cards. In a note card, we write specific information along with references it. We then organize the note cards and use them for writing papers or books. This method has a few drawbacks, namely, it will be difficult to keep all the cards organized as we add cards, and it will become more difficult to find a specific card quickly. Therefore, people usually write new cards for each new project. This is inefficient.</p>

            <h3>Solution: </h3>
            <p>Introducing GraphNotes, I offer a solution this problem. This is a software for organizing and easily retrieving key scientific concepts. As you read textbooks or journal articles, you come across critical concepts that will be likely useful in the future. You can store them in GraphNotes and find them quickly whenever you need them. GraphNotes uses a graph to store concepts. Each concept comprises a node in a graph. If there is a relation between two concepts, it will be an link between the concepts. Each node or link can store as many descriptions and references as necessary. When you need to retrieve a specific information, you can search within nodes, or references or links, and quickly find what you were looking for.
            </p>

            <h2> How to use it? </h2>

            <h3> Initializing the program for the first time </h3>
            <p> If it is the first time that you open GraphNotes, it will ask you for a location to store its database file. The database file stores all the information you enter into the program, so keep it in a safe location (I recommend your Dropbox or other cloud storages folder). You can back it up and open it on other computers.</p>

            <h3> Adding a single concept and its descriptions </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Click on the <i> Add data </i> button. </li>
                <li> Type information in the <i> Concept 1 </i> section </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> To make organizing information easier, each concept has a <i> Subcategory </i> field. Use the <i> Subcategory </i> field to add specific details about a more generation concept. For example, if you want to add information about the speed of light, you may type "Light" in the concept field, and type "Speed of" in the subcategory field. </li>
                    
                    <li> The <i> Synonyms </i> field is for writing other ways that the same concept may be written, so that searching for either of them will return the same retuls. </li>

                    <li> The <i>Study</i> field specifies the type of study of the reference, e.g. it can be an experimental or a theoretical study. </li>

                    <li> To add a reference, wright click in the white are of the <i>Reference</i> field and click on the <i>New reference</i> option. You may either type in the reference details or import references from a bibtex file. </li>

                    <li> You may leave any field blank. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3> Adding a relation between two concepts </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Click on the <i> Add data </i> button. </li>
                <li> Type the first concept, and if you like a <i> Subcategory </i> for the first concept. </li>
                <li> Type the second concept, and if you like a <i> Subcategory </i> for the second concept. </li>
                <li> Type a description for the relation between the two concepts in the <i>Relatin</i> field. </li>
                <li> You may add a study type in the <i> Study </i> field.</li>
                <li> To add a reference, wright click in the white are of the <i>Reference</i> field and click on the <i>New reference</i> option. You may either type in the reference details or import references from a bibtex file.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Searching </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Type in a work in the <i> Search </i> field in the main window. </li>
                <li> Use check boxes below the search field to specify where to search. </li>
                <li> The search results appear in the <i> Concepts</i> area. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> All the steps above can be repeated, i.e. a concept can have multiple descriptions and relations. </p>
