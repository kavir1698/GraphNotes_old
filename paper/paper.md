# Summary

Research requires remembering many facts and details with credible references. It is easy to forget a specifc piece of information after a few days or months, or forget where you read it. Scientists usually mark PDF files or write down important details in text documents. These files can quickly pile up and make it tedious to find specific information.

A traditional method for gathering all the necessary information is using paper note cards. In a note card, we write specific information along with their references. We then organize the note cards and use them for writing papers or books. This method has a few drawbacks, namely, it will be difficult to keep all the cards organized as we add more of them, and it will become more difficult to find a specific card quickly. Therefore, people usually prepare and keep a separate set of note cards for each project. This is inefficient!

Introducing GraphNotes, I offer a solution to this problem. This is a software for organizing and easily retrieving scientific concepts. As you read textbooks or journal articles, you come across critical concepts that will be likely useful in the future. You can store them in GraphNotes and find them quickly whenever you need them. GraphNotes uses a graph structure to store your notes. A graph is a series of nodes that are connected to one another if there is a relationship between any two nodes. Each concept comprises a node in the graph. If there is a relation between two concepts, it will be an link between the concepts. Each node or link can store as many descriptions and references as necessary. When you need to retrieve a specific information, all you need is to search for the concept you are looking for, and see all descriptions about it, and all of its relations with other concepts. The figure below shows a schematic view of how concepts and their relations are organized in GraphNotes. The figure shows descriptions for two concepts and a relation between them, in a graph with five nodes and five edges.
